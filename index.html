                    <p>
                        The Common-Practice Cadence Corpus (CPCC) consists of over a thousand expertly-encoded cadences. 
                        Cadences are ubiquitous in the Western music tradition and much ink has been spilled over the
                        cande. One book pertinent to the common-practice cadence is <i>What is a Cadence?</i> 
                        edited by Markus Neuwirth and Pieter Berg&eacute;. The book contains 9 essays, each critically questioning
                        cadential meaning through different approaches and modalities. The CPCC intends to further question the properties of cadences, 
                        their place in our discipline, and to expand on their study by bringing questions from empirical research domains. 
                        By providing a rigorously defined and hand-encoded corpus, the CPCC might later be involved in questions of closure, style, meter, schematic patterns, etc. The dataset currently contains 
                        cadences from the 18thâ€“19th century, but the project is ongoing and, as such, still expanding. If you would like to get involved or
                        have specific cadence questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
