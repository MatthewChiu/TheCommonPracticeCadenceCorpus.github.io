        <h3>The Background</h3>
        <p>
            The Common-Practice Cadence Corpus (CPCC) consists of over a thousand expertly-encoded cadences. The dataset currently contains 
            cadences from the 18thâ€“19th century, but the project is ongoing and, as such, still expanding.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Here's the one language project we might(?) present someday
        </p>

        <h3>The People</h3>
        <p>
            The corpus started as a co-authored project between <a href = "https://www.derekjmyler.com/">Derek J. Myler</a>
            and <a href = "mattchiu.com">Matt Chiu</a>.
