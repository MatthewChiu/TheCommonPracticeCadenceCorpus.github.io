            <h3>Chord Encoding</h3>
            <p>
                Following encoding methodologies such as Cuthbert and Ariza (2010) and White and Quinn (2018), 
                we encoded cadences from a discrete time series of vertical musical "slices." We considered cadences
                to be comprised of (at most) two chords: 1) The chord it concludes with and 2) the chord immediately prior. 
                Within those chords, vertical slices capture the ongoing counterpoint. An example in shown below. <br><br>
                In the example, the cadence includes V and I in C major, shown in the "roman numeral" column. The vertical slices
                are used to encode the outer-voice counterpoint. We call each slice a <i>stage</i> in the cadence; this cadence includes 
                9 stages. Each stage includes the measure in the piece and beat position, followed by counterpoint in scale degrees. 
                So "[31,1][3,5]" means the music has a cadence slice starting on measure 31, beat 1 with scale degree 3 in the soprano
                and 5 in the bass.
